This repository has Python files with code blocks and scripts representating illustration of core Python dtypes, data strucutures, libraries and data engineering workflows.
The code blocks and scripts cover core concepts like data types/structures, their internal representation, memory model, storage layout, performance considerations, use cases.
Important topics like performance/memory overhead trade off, SIMD, Vectorized operations, contiguous memory layout, Python objects, Numpy dtypes covered. 
Data structures like Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Sets, Frozen Sets, ndArrays, Dataframes and their memory map/model/overhead and storage layout with use cases.

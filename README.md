This repository has Python files with code blocks and scripts representating illustration of core Python dtypes, data strucutures, libraries and data engineering workflows.
Core built in Python data types like int, float, complex numbers, string, boolean, bytearrays and their memory model, storage layout, performance considerations, use cases.
Important topics like performance/memory overhead trade off, SIMD, Vectorized operations, contiguous memory layout, Python objects, Numpy dtypes covered. 
Data structures like Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Sets, Frozen Sets, ndArrays, Dataframes and their memory map/model/overhead and storage layout with use cases.
Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Pyspark, SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2, Requests, Google Cloud client libraries and their use cases. 
Using built in operations and functions for data ingestion, storage, processing, orchestration and serving to consumers.
